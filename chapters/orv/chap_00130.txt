<title>Ch 130: Ep. 25 - Those Who Face a God, IV
Yoo Joonghyuk glared at me and said, "It is too unreasonable with your skills."
Messages poured in.
<!>[Constellations who hate the Korean Peninsula are showing hatred.]
<!>[Constellations who hate violence and slaughter are going crazy.]
<!>[Constellations who hate the Korean Peninsula desires your death.]
I looked at the Japanese incarnations. Their sponsors were all people I knew. They had entered Bihyung's channel and drove someone I knew to death.
"I made a promise. Thus, I have to catch him."
"Promise?"
The first promise was to kill the dokkaebi and the second promise was to revive her. Finally, there was the third promise. It was this.
"I promised to get revenge on the constellations who killed her."
Yoo Joonghyuk probably understood from these words alone. Maybe in this world, only Yoo Joonghyuk could understand. Yoo Joonghyuk replied, "I can't concede because of that."
"…This bastard really doesn't understand."
We started moving as soon as we finished talking. The place where we were standing was destroyed and the head of the giant snake stared at us.
<!>[The constellation 'Sovereign of Eight Heads' is furious!]
It was a fearsome presence. It wasn't just the body but the 'shadow' of the constellation. This much power was revealed despite only a handful of the probability constraints being lifted.
This was the dignity of the narrative-grade. It was an opponent that I would've normally never dealt with.
<&>「 Yamata no Orochi. He was interpreted as an evil spirit in ancient Japanese mythology. There is only one way to deal with him at this point. 」
I observed Yoo Joonghyuk's sword and said, "You have obtained the Totsuka-no-tsurugi."
In the original third regression, Yoo Joonghyuk didn't get the sword. It was probably because Yoo Joonghyuk had become stronger in this round.
Yoo Joonghyuk wondered, "…You know this sword."
"I know. It is a famous sword."
Totsuka-no-tsurugi. It was the sword used by Susanoo to cut down Yamata no Orochi. In other words, in a distant story, it defeated Yamata no Orochi once.
It was the same as Gyebaek and Ito. The history of 'defeat' was a fatal weakness for all beings made of stories. The eight heads cried at once and shed bloody tears.
<@>[Cheeky…worms…]
Crazy… was he using his true voice?
<!>[The exclusive skill, 'Fourth Wall' is strongly activated!]
The whole area was devastated with a single word. More than half the small people who heard it died of their internal organs rupturing. Lee Jihye and Lee Gilyoung coughed up blood and also collapsed. There were even disasters who bled after hearing the words.
Of course, I had the 'wall' and Yoo Joonghyuk's Mind Barrier had a high level so we could endure it.
"You don't speak well so shut up." I taunted him. However, the snake didn't use his true voice again. He didn't have sufficient permissions so using his true voice consumed a large amount of probability. Instead, his anger led to action.
The eight heads simultaneously breathed out fire, turning the area into a furnace. We quickly ran behind a wall. It was Yoo Joonghyuk who acted first.
<!>[The character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has used 'Giant Body Transformation Lv. 2!]
As expected, this skill had also been passed to him. I thought that I should learn this skill.
Yoo Joonghyuk's body swelled up he leapt into the air. Giant Body Transformation was a technique that temporarily exploded the latent power of a body to imitate the power of a giant.
For a short time, Yoo Joonghyuk's combat power would be even stronger than it was before he became a small person. The problem was the duration of the skill was only five minutes.
The [Heaven-Rousing Supreme] Energy filled Totsuka-no-tsurugi. Yoo Joonghyuk kicked off from the wall and rushed forward. [Heaven-Rousing Supreme] reached a perfect state and gushed out from the ether blade.
Heaven-Rousing Supreme Sword.
Vanish.
Heaven-Rousing Supreme Desolation.
The flash of light that emerged from Yoo Joonghyuk's sword split into dozens of branches and struck the snake.
Gruesome black blood emerged from the wounds caused by Totsuka-no-tsurugi and one of the eight heads started to rot.
This was the only sword that could kill Yamata no Orochi. Yoo Joonghyuk wasn't a constellation so Stage Transformation didn't occur. Still, it was obvious that the sword was effective.
<!>[The constellation 'Sovereign of Eight Heads' is howling.]
One head was cut off but Yamata no Orochi was still intact. In order to kill him, all eight heads must be cut off.
Yoo Joonghyuk didn't hesitate and jumped towards the second head. The battle was so gorgeous that no one could interrupt. It was amazing as Yoo Joonghyuk zigzagged to avoid the heads and tail
The main character was the main character for a reason. Even so, a person like this died over a hundred times in Ways of Survival. Once again, this world was terrible.
"Kim Dokja! Are you going to just watch? Didn't you say you would catch him?"
Yoo Joonghyuk destroyed three heads in an instant and shouted towards me as he gasped. It seemed like he was losing steam?
I smiled and replied, "Ah, I meant I would deal the final blow."
"You bastard!"
I leisurely managed my stamina and waited. It wasn't time yet.
On the other hand, Yoo Joonghyuk was in a hurry and squeezed out all his fearsome strength at once to hit the other heads. In the process of cutting off the fourth head, Yoo Joonghyuk's 'Giant Body Transformation' was released.
Flames and poison poured out from the snake's heads at once. Yoo Joonghyuk dodged with agile movements but couldn't escape being damaged by the tail.
<!>[The character 'Yoo Joonghyuk' has used 'Strong Self-Defense Lv. 9'.]
Only the tip of the tail touched him but Yoo Joonghyuk's body was thrown back into the castle's wall. The bloody Yoo Joonghyuk emerged from the terrible dust clouds.
"Kim Dokja! Your help…"
"I'm going to act now."
"Stupid person! You can't do it alone! Back off now and later―"
"You've had a hard time. Now it is your turn to watch me."
The moment the remaining four heads gazed at me, I picked up Totsuka-no-tsurugi from the ground and ran towards Orochi.
<!>[The number five bookmark has been activated.]
<!>[Activation Time: Three minutes.]
<!>[Your understanding of the character is low, so only a part of the character's skill is activated.]
It was fine. This much was still good.
<!>[The skill can only be used by a 'small person'.]
<!>[Your current body configuration is similar to the physical makeup of the character.]
I only needed one skill anyway.
<!>[The level of the character is too high to fully reproduce the skill level.]
<!>[The level of the skill being activated is forcibly adjusted.]
<!>[The exclusive skill 'Electrification Lv. 10' is activated.]
<&>「 The magnitude of the consciousness determines the degree of existence, making it possible for the smallest being to see the greatest universe. 」
The phrases left by Kyrgios in Ways of Survival passed through my head and the flow of magic power around me changed. The magic power soon became particles and the electrons that resonated with each other started to tremble violently.
<&>「There is a beginning in existence, so the smallest is the greatest. 」
There was the sound of something popping deep in my mind. Maybe it was something like the coolness of the Big Bang. I opened my eyes and saw my body covered with a blue-white lightning. It was like I had become lightning.
The formidable power was wriggling inside me. It felt like I could do anything. If I wanted to penetrate the sky, I would penetrate the sky. If I wanted to separate the sea, I would do so. Then if I wanted to cut off this snake's head, I would cut it.
There was a roar as I took the first step. Then with the second step, I appeared right in front of the snake's neck. The third step caused the white lightning to scream in the area and then the fourth step…
I passed by Orochi, leaving a storm behind. My feet were damaged by the lightning and blood poured from my nose and mouth. My body stumbled like I was experiencing an electric shock.
I looked back and saw three snake heads falling to the ground. I drank a magic power recovery potion and the swelling in my hand decreased.
<img>[130 - I looked back and saw three snake heads falling to the ground.jpg][]
<!>[The constellation 'Sovereign of Eight Heads' is shocked by your swordsmanship.]
In just a moment, Orochi had one head left and was floundering from the pain.
<!>[The constellation 'Sovereign of Eight Heads' is questioning the fairness of the scenario!]
I laughed loudly. "…You are raising an issue of fairness?"
The duration of Electrification was three minutes but right now, my body couldn't take more than three steps. In other words, I had to kill him in three steps.
Sparks filled the air and then that damn voice was heard again.
<@>[Geez, a person of noble blood looks so ugly.]
I thought I would hear this voice. The intermediate dokkaebi Ganul was looking down at this place.
<@>[…Ah, really. I can't just watch. This is a big problem.]
Unlike his words, he didn't seem to want to interfere.
<!>[The constellation 'Sovereign of Eight Heads' is shouting with anger.]
<@>[Hrmm, you can't make an impossible demand. As you can see, you've used up all the probability allowed in this scenario. 'They' can't lend you any more power.]
Yamata no Orochi's roar covered all of Peace Land. This must've been the first humiliation that the narrative-grade Yamata no Orochi had experienced.
Someone was always a spectacle. Now the victim of the spectacle was himself. He was filled with anger. There might be only one head left but Orochi's strength was increasing.
"Protect the king!" The confused Japanese incarnations ran forward. This was the power of the Absolute Throne.
I heard a message from the dokkaebi Youngki in my head.
–D-Dokja-ssi. The channel is about to burst. I will block the indirect messages for a while!
I was currently using the power of Kyrgios so all types of constellations would come to watch me.
"Stop!"
My party members regained their spirits and ran to stop the disasters. Lee Hyunsung barely raised his bloody body while Gong Pildu supported them with gunfire.
Meanwhile, Yamata no Orochi was preparing for the final reversal.
<@>[No, wait a minute! Hey Constellation! What are you doing…!]
An ominous current was appearing around Izumi's body, the incarnation of Yamata no Orochi. It was the sign of a probability storm. The panicked dokkaebi shouted.
<@>[L-Look here! Turn back! The bureau! It is an emergency!]
It was a real disaster brought about by the desire not to be defeated by me. The dokkaebi belatedly used the system control but it was unfortunately too late.
The Great Hole opened in the wide sky.
I realized that Orochi had crossed the line. He even borrowed the probability that the supreme being granted to the Absolute Throne.
"Ahh, ah!"
Everyone held their breaths as they stared at the sky.
<!>[Someone has interfered with the scenario system.]
Restless sensations were surging from the Great Hole. Chaos. Disorder. A void. It was the origin of all fear. This existence was lending its probability to Yamata no Orochi.
The shadow of the remaining snake head started to grow larger due to the probability. It grew bigger and bigger. It would grow until it covered the castle and the entire planet.
<!>[Measuring… sword…!]
All beings, whether they were incarnations or small people, collapsed on the ground and groaned as they coughed up blood. The dreadful difference pressed heavily on my body. My knees were forced to the ground. Everything was the worst.
<@>[Mere… hum…ans… going… against… a… great… star…!]
I instinctively realized. I couldn't win even if I used Electrification. At my level, I couldn't win even if I woke up the dead.
Nevertheless, I laughed. "You just made the worst mistake."
The Star Stream was about balance. If someone destroyed the probability then someone else would obtain it. Thus, the balance would now be adjusted.
A fearsome aura was coming from a distance at a rapid pace. It wasn't Yamata no Orochi or the unknown god beyond the Great Hole. However, nobody here could ignore this arrogant existence.
<@>[Since when could a god from another world intervene in the scenario?]
He was the absolute being born on this planet.
<@>[Don't get involved in my planet's matters, if you don't want to confront me where my story began.]
The White Purity, Kyrgios Rodgraim.
<@>[Get lost! Monster of this world!]
Lightning stretched out as Kyrgios soared towards the sky. It was a powerful force that wasn't pushed back at all by a narrative-grade constellation.
<img>[130 - Lightning stretched out as Kyrgios soared towards the sky.jpg][]
Kyrgios revealed his true strength and broke through the tentacles, forcibly closing the entrance of the Great Hole. Then Orochi's power started plummeting.
<@>[This… ah… ah…! You…!]
I didn't miss this gap and used the remaining three steps. All the magic power in my body flowed towards Totsuka-no-tsurugi.
Then I saw the incarnation of Yamata no Orochi smiling at me. It was an expression that welcomed the long-awaited liberation.
Killing one person to save other people's lives. The selfish sword moved and something rolled along the ground.
<@>[You have killed a person.]
<!>[You have been deprived of the title of 'King of No Killing'.]
The constellation of Yamata no Orochi blinked from the severe blow. There was a terrible scream and the shadow of the constellation started to scatter into ashes.
<!>[An unbelievable feat has been accomplished.]
<!>[You have hunted a 'King of Disasters' for the first time!]
<!>[The script of the 'King of Disasters' being defeated in this scenario wasn't expected!]
<!>[You have achieved an impossible feat!]
<!>[Due to the completion of an impossible story, all dokkaebis of the Seoul Dome and Tokyo Dome will enter an emergency meeting.]
I looked up at the constellations shining in the sky. All of them wouldn't know. It was the feeling of a person running hard only to arrive at the starting point.
<!>[Congratulations! The Star Stream has acknowledged your grade.]
<!>[You have accomplished a total of four stories.]
The end of the sixth scenario. I finally arrived at the starting point towards the end I wanted.
<!>[Now you must build your last story to become a constellation.]
